## 🚧 My Long, Bumpy Road to Landing the First Dev Job

When someone chooses their future profession, they usually imagine what their dream job will be — what it looks like, how it feels, and what kind of work they'll be doing. Of course, that vision can change over time...

> _“a dark room, more than one monitor, and lots of mysterious scripts running on the screens.”_  
> Sounds funny, right?

I started with PHP. I barely understood what it was, but that didn't stop me. Fast forward — university helped bring structure. I learned HTML, CSS, basic JS, and even ran my first `Hello World!` in C++.

Looking back, I thought I was ready for the job market — I was not 😅.

Still, **motivation** kept me going. I kept practicing, building side projects, and getting rejections.

> _“Unfortunately…”_ became a frequent guest in my inbox.

Eventually, persistence paid off. One real opportunity changed everything. Was it fate? Or just stubbornness finally rewarded? 🧐

## ❗ What Problems I Faced Most of All

🎉 I landed a real job as a Junior Full-Stack Engineer!  
😨 Then came the **real panic**.

A huge codebase. Jira. Slack. AWS. Databases. Environments. SSH keys.  
It felt like being thrown into the ocean and told to swim.

> **Break big, scary problems into small, manageable pieces — start from the easiest, then work your way up.**

### 🔄 The Big Mindset Shift

- As a Junior, **you’re not expected to know everything**
- But **staying silent?** That’s a red flag 🚩
- Ask questions. Then ask again. Then again.

### 🧠 Rookie Mistakes I Made

- Rushing to close tickets ✅
- Forgetting to **double-check** my own work 🧐
- Getting the same feedback over and over 📬

> It's not about how fast you close a ticket.  
> It's about how much cleanup and follow-up it takes afterward.

💡 Lesson: Slow down. Think. Test. Understand the **why**.

### 😱 Fear of Breaking Stuff

> _“If I click this, will the company’s servers explode?”_

Been there. Still there sometimes.

When in doubt:

1. Explore first 🧭
2. Ask next 🙋‍♀️
3. Google when appropriate 🔍

> ❗ **Not knowing isn't a sin. Staying silent is.**

### 🧪 Writing Tests Was My Nightmare

Test cases? Ugh.  
Sometimes `console.log()` didn’t even help.  
Everything was harder than expected.

But eventually...

🎯 One day, I got a new task and — magic ✨  
I _knew_ what to do.  
I opened the right file. Wrote code. It worked.  
For the first time, I felt **confident**.

> _"I saw myself on stage, Steve Jobs-style, launching my code."_  
> Cringe? Maybe.  
> But for me — that was the first **spark of confidence**.

---

### 📉 The Real Struggle? Discipline

It wasn’t the code, the tools, or the tech.  
It was the lack of **focus**, **consistency**, and **routine**.

> _Discipline isn’t glamorous. But it’s half the battle._

## 🛠️ How to Use Modern Tools Wisely

AI is here. And no, it’s not taking your job.  
It’s your **co-pilot** — not your replacement.

> _“The developer is the pilot. AI is just the co-pilot.”_

---

### 💬 How I Use AI Daily

#### 🧠 Trick #1: Ask AI to **Explain Code**

When I don’t understand something:

> _“Explain this block of code in plain English.”_

It’s like having a senior developer sitting next to you — judgment-free, 24/7.

#### 🧼 Trick #2: Ask AI to **Refactor Code**

Got working code that’s a bit... messy?

🧦 Code that works but looks like socks with sandals?

Ask AI to:

- Simplify it
- Apply principles like **KISS**, **DRY**, **YAGNI**
- Explain why their version is better

> Cleaner code = fewer bugs = easier reviews = happier lead = happier you

---

### 🧪 Trick #3: Use AI for **Testing Strategy**

Don’t just say:

> _“Write a test for this.”_

Instead:

> _“Generate all the use cases I should test for this component.”_

What you get is:

- A checklist ✅
- A strategy 📋
- A confidence boost 💪

---

### 🚨 Bonus: Use AI for Debugging

Copy error message → Paste into AI → Ask:

> _“What’s causing this error? How do I fix it?”_

Let AI **shape your thinking**, not replace it.

---

### 🔁 Final Thoughts on AI

With time:

- You’ll rely on it less
- You’ll learn faster
- You’ll grow more confident

And that’s the **real** goal 🎯
